## Project Overview

The Credit Risk Model uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a loan applicant defaulting on a loan. It assesses various factors, including personal, financial, and credit history, to output a risk level. This app is built with Streamlit for easy web deployment and user interaction.

## Features

- **Real-Time Predictions**: Enter applicant details and receive immediate risk predictions.
- **Interpretability**: Feature importance scores to understand key factors affecting predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate UI developed with Streamlit.
- **Model Metrics**: Displays model accuracy and relevant metrics for transparency.

  ### Usage
  Credit risk modeling assesses the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on loans. It uses historical data and statistical methods to evaluate borrower creditworthiness. Effective usage includes determining loan terms, setting interest rates, and minimizing risk exposure for lenders. Models provide insights for decision-making and help financial institutions identify high-risk customers, enabling them to tailor products and strategies accordingly. Continuous improvements and adjustments based on new data ensure models remain relevant and accurate in predicting credit risk.
